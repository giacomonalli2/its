Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It refers to the practice of bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. This concept helps in protecting the internal state of an object from unintended or unauthorized access and modification.

In Java, encapsulation is achieved by:

Declaring variables as private – which restricts direct access from outside the class.

Providing public getter and setter methods – which allow controlled access and modification of the private variables.

By using encapsulation, developers can:

Maintain data integrity by controlling how data is accessed or changed.

Hide implementation details and expose only the necessary functionality to the user (data hiding).

Improve code maintainability and flexibility, as internal changes can be made without affecting external code that uses the class.

Encapsulation allows Java classes to act as self-contained modules with clearly defined interfaces, leading to cleaner, safer, and more organized code.
